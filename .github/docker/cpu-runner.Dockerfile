# gpu-runner image for FlagTrain CI — the nvidia-cuda133 backend (H20, CUDA 13.3).
#
# Unlike flaggems-runner.dockerfile (pure-CPU lint/registry pre-checks), the
# suites under tests/deepspeed/ execute real Triton kernels and compare them
# against DeepSpeed's own CUDA ops, so this image starts from the vendor base
# image and is only useful on a host with an NVIDIA device passed through.
#
# This reproduces the container recipe verified in ci.md, with the versions
# backends.yaml pins, and bakes it in so the workflows install NOTHING at run
# time:
#
#   - nvcc from cuda-toolkit-13-3. The base is the NGC *runtime* tag: CUDA
#     runtime libraries, no compiler. Both DeepSpeed ops the tests import
#     (fused_lamb, ragged_device_ops) are JIT-built with nvcc on first use.
#   - /opt/venv: python3.12 with torch 2.11.0+cu130, flagtree 0.7.0 (which is
#     the `triton` module for this backend), flagcx, deepspeed 0.19.7 +
#     deepspeed-kernels, and the test tooling (pytest, pyyaml, sqlalchemy).
#     PATH puts the venv first, so `python`, `pip` and `pytest` resolve to it
#     in every shell — workflows need no `source activate`.
#
# Run-time contract:
#   - Run `pytest` from the repository root: pytest.ini sets testpaths=tests
#     and pythonpath=src, so a checkout needs no install to be importable.
#   - Run with the device passed through (`--gpus all` or the equivalent
#     device mounts) — the suites are what exercise CUDA, not this image.
#   - A job that needs `import flag_train` from outside the repo root runs
#     `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`; setuptools>=77 is baked, so
#     that needs no network.
#
# What is deliberately absent:
#
#   - The FlagTrain package itself. CI tests the checkout of the revision
#     under review, which cannot be baked into an image.
#   - torchaudio and torchvision, although backends.yaml lists them beside
#     torch. Nothing under tests/ or benchmark/ imports either, and each is
#     another few hundred MB in an image that is pulled per job — add the two
#     pinned lines to the torch step if a component starts needing them.
#   - Pre-built DeepSpeed op caches. Build hosts have no GPU, so
#     deepspeed's jit_load() takes its build_for_cpu branch and emits a
#     different nvcc command line than the run-time build does
#     (-DBF16_AVAILABLE and friends are skipped), and ninja rebuilds whenever
#     the command line changes — a cache baked here would not be reused, only
#     add weight. The two JIT cache directories are pinned to fixed paths
#     instead (see the bottom), so a job that mounts them keeps the DeepSpeed
#     builds and Triton kernel compilations on the node instead of paying for
#     them once per job.
#
# Package indexes: pypi.org is not reliably reachable from the networks these
# images are built and run on (connections to it time out), so the aliyun
# mirror plus the FlagOS nexus are the only sources. torch's +cu130 build, flagtree and flagcx exist
# only on the nexus. The mirror is exported as ENV too, so pip behaves the
# same way at run time.
#
# Sources of truth: ci.md (the flow this file reproduces step for step) and
# backends.yaml (the backend's version pins). Rebuild this image when either
# moves. One known drift: backends.yaml pins deepspeed-kernels==0.0.1, which
# does not resolve — PyPI has only 0.0.1.dev* wheels — so it is installed
# unpinned here (see the DeepSpeed section).
#
# Build — there is no COPY and the context is unused, so any directory works:
#   docker build -f flagtrain-runner.dockerfile -t <registry>/flagtrain-runner:cuda13.3.0 .

# --- torch -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The +cu130 build (backends.yaml) is the official PyTorch CUDA-13.0 wheel,
# carried on the FlagOS nexus. Installing it drags in upstream triton==3.6.0 —
# torch declares it for Linux — which the following step removes: flagtree

# `===`, not `==`: `==0.7.0` also matches the per-vendor local versions on the
# nexus (0.7.0+tileir3.6, 0.7.0+metax3.6, ...) and pip picks one of those
# arbitrary variants; `===0.7.0` is the exact-string match that selects the
# plain CUDA wheel.
# The removal loop is ci.md's "repeat until fully uninstalled": one uninstall
# can leave a dist-info behind, and both distribution names are covered
# because upstream ships as `triton` while NVIDIA's build of it ships as
# `pytorch-triton`. Failing the build if any survives is deliberate — a
# leftover upstream triton would shadow flagtree's module at run time and the
# tests would silently exercise the wrong compiler.

# --- DeepSpeed + test tooling ----------------------------------------------
# deepspeed 0.19.7 (backends.yaml) installs from the sdist and compiles its
# ops later, on the GPU; the sdist build itself needs no nvcc.
# deepspeed-kernels supplies `dskernels`, whose prebuilt libblockedflash the
# nvidia tier of the blocked_flash tests requires (RaggedOpsBuilder links
# -lblockedflash from it — see tests/deepspeed/test_blocked_flash.py). It is
# left unpinned because PyPI has no 0.0.1 release, only 0.0.1.dev* wheels;
# pip takes the newest. Pin it to a 0.0.1.dev<timestamp> here and in
# backends.yaml if the CI needs that determinism.
# pytest/pyyaml/sqlalchemy are what the suites import: conftest's yaml
# handling, the tune configs, and flag_train.utils.models.sql.
# All of these come from the mirror; the nexus does not carry them, so no
# extra index is passed here — a package resolving from somewhere unexpected
# would be a surprise, not a rescue.

# (TRITON_CACHE_DIR) default under $HOME, which differs per job inside a
# runner container and dies with it. Pinning both to fixed world-writable
# paths lets a job that mounts a host directory there keep them across jobs on
# that node — the same trick as PRE_COMMIT_HOME in flaggems-runner.dockerfile.
# A mounted cache outlives the code that filled it: TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR is
# keyed by op name and nvcc command line, not by DeepSpeed version, so clear
# it when deepspeed is bumped. Without a mount these are ordinary
# per-container caches and nothing changes.

# ci.md exports the CUDA 13.3 compat directory ahead of the library path. If

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH costs nothing. The base image already puts
# /usr/local/cuda/bin on PATH.
