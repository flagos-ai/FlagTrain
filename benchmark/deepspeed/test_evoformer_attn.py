"""Performance benchmark for the evoformer attention operator.

Upstream has no performance test for this operator -- only
``tests/unit/ops/deepspeed4science/test_DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention.py``, which is
functional. So this file is new work, and the baseline is chosen the same way the
other DeepSpeed benchmarks here choose theirs:

* on a backend in ``_DEEPSPEED_BASELINE_VENDORS``, DeepSpeed's
  ``DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention`` **is** the baseline. If it cannot be loaded there
  the module raises rather than falling back -- timing the torch reference and
  reporting it under the same name would answer a different question;
* on any other backend the baseline is the torch composition below, the same
  contract written out in plain torch.

Only the forward is measured, because only the forward is ported: upstream's
``attention_bwd`` and its trainable entry are absent from this package.

FLOPS are not reported. The quantity is ``4 * B * N * H * L^2 * D`` (two matmuls,
counting a multiply-add as two), but the operator is
memory-bound at these sizes -- ``L`` is a few hundred and ``D`` at most 64 -- so
the number would flatter a kernel that is waiting on the bias matrices rather
than computing.

#
# Upstream's two cases are in here. The rest move the axes this operator is made
# of, rather than sweeping sizes, because what the kernel does with a shape
# depends on which axis it is:
#
#   * ``N`` (pairs) is the evoformer axis and the one that costs without
#     computing: every pair reads the *same* ``bias2`` (``[B, 1, H, L, L]``, and
#     L x L per head regardless of N) and every pair tile attends over its own
#     L x L scores. So N is the "how much work per byte of bias" axis: the two
#     N = 1024 rows below are the pair-heavy end, and everything else is the
#     small-N end.
#   * ``L`` sets both the score matrix (L^2) and the bias2 read (L^2 per head), so
#     it is the axis the operator scales on -- and the one where it can least
#     afford to re-read. L = 1024 is there for that.
#   * ``L`` also has a floor: below the 64-row tile there is a single query tile,
#     so the grid collapses to one block per (head, pair) and any fixed per-CTA
#     cost shows up -- hence the two L = 64 rows.
#   * ``D`` caps at 64, and the wide end is where the qk^T dot is worth tensor
#     cores while the narrow end is mostly bias arithmetic.
#   * ``B`` only tells the two biases apart (``bias1`` is per pair, ``bias2`` per
#     batch), so one multi-batch row is enough.
