"""Performance benchmark for the LAMB operator.

The baseline follows ``_DEEPSPEED_BASELINE_VENDORS`` below:

* on a listed backend, DeepSpeed's ``fused_lamb`` **is** the baseline. If it cannot
  be built there the module raises rather than falling back -- measuring the torch
  reference and reporting it under the same name would answer a different question;
* on any other backend the baseline is ``lamb_ref``, the plain-torch composition of
  the same contract, whether or not ``deepspeed`` is installed there. It is not a
  competitor, and the speedup there says how far the kernel is from *a* correct
  implementation rather than from the best one.

Both baselines take the same argument tuple as the operator, so unlike the
blocked-flash benchmark there is nothing to pre-compute outside the timed region.
