"""Correctness tests for the evoformer attention forward.

Two oracles, because they fail differently:

* ``DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention`` -- DeepSpeed's own operator, the thing this port
  claims to replace. On a backend in ``_DEEPSPEED_BASELINE_VENDORS`` it is
  *required*: if it will not load there the module raises rather than losing the
  check quietly. Its version is recorded in ``_DEEPSPEED_VERSION``, as
  tests/deepspeed/README.md asks for.
* ``_reference`` -- the same contract composed from plain torch: no tiling, no
  online softmax, no running max. It runs on any device, so the operator is
  testable off NVIDIA.

The reference is not implied by the DeepSpeed oracle: both could be wrong the
same way, and the reference is the only one that can disagree with a *reading*
of the contract rather than with one implementation of it.

Only the forward is covered, because only the forward is ported -- upstream's
``attention_bwd`` and its trainable entry are absent, not stubbed, so there is
nothing here to test them against.

Cases are seeded, so a failure reproduces rather than depending on the draw.

    Worth pinning rather than fixing. ``softmax`` of a row whose every score is

    the running max is -inf, so ``exp2(-inf - -inf)`` is ``exp2(nan)``. A port
    that quietly turned those rows into zeros would be *changing the gradient a
    training loop sees* while looking tidier, so the NaN is part of the contract
    this port takes on -- and the rows that are not fully masked must still be
    right, which the second half of the test checks (a "just clamp it" fix would
    break that half instead).

    The row is masked with an actual ``-inf``, not with the ``1e9 * (mask - 1)``
    recipe upstream's test uses. That recipe is a mask only where it *overflows*:
    fp16 tops out at 65504 so -1e9 becomes -inf, but bf16 has fp32's exponent
    range, so -1e9 stays finite -- and a finite constant added to a whole row
    cancels in the softmax, which is to say it masks nothing. As a *key* mask the
    recipe works in both dtypes (the constant is per key position, not per row,
    so it does not cancel); ``test_a_masked_key_contributes_nothing`` runs it in
    both.

    ``bias2`` is what masks a row: ``bias1`` has one value per key position, so it
