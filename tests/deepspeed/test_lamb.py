"""Correctness tests for the LAMB operator.

Two oracles, because they fail differently:

* ``lamb_ref`` -- a plain-torch composition of the same contract. It is the
  primary check and runs on any device, so the operator is testable off NVIDIA.
* DeepSpeed's ``fused_lamb`` -- the operator this implementation ports. It is an
  independent implementation and its version is recorded in
  ``_DEEPSPEED_VERSION``, as tests/deepspeed/README.md asks for, but it needs the
  ``deepspeed`` package, and on a backend in ``_DEEPSPEED_BASELINE_VENDORS`` below
  it is *required* -- if it will not load there the module raises rather than
  losing the check quietly. On other backends it is an additional check that is
  skipped.

Checking both is not redundant: ``lamb_ref`` is the same arithmetic written from
the same reading of the kernel, so a shared misreading of the contract would
survive it. DeepSpeed's operator is the only oracle that can disagree with that
reading.
